# Step-by-step guide to DCM for fMRI and PEB
This step-by-step guide walks through performing a DCM for fMRI analysis and testing hypotheses at the group level using PEB. 

**This is a work in progress awaiting review.**

## The paper
You may wish to start with the theory paper, which explains how each step in the analysis works:
